# Private Chat
Encrypts text you want to send to someone via any text sharing platform (email/SMS/messaging apps). Decrypts text received from someone via any text sharing platform. Both of you have to agree to a secret password beforehand to be able to encrypt and decrypt your texts. Private Chat was created because it would be silly to trust that messages sent via any external server that belongs to any messaging platform is truly end-to-end encrypted and that nobody else can read it. If any data harvesting algorithms are recording the messages and either sharing it with scammers or advertisers, it is worth encrypting messages with Private Chat before sending messages via those messaging apps.  
Private Chat does not need to be connected to the internet to work. Only if you open the website from "github.io" you need to initially be connected to the internet while the page loads. After that Private Chat works completely offline, and does not have to transmit any data anywhere. You also have the option to simply download this repository and click the `index.html` page to run Private Chat locally. The entire source code is freely available to verify everything that the algorithm does.  
Private Chat was created when the author noticed that he was receiving advertisements related to the SMS he was sending his contacts. Since there is no guarantee that even the so-called end-to-end encryption of messaging apps is truly not visible to the people who control the servers (and hence perhaps becoming accessible to fraudsters or via any malware), it became necessary to implement some encryption by oneself to protect [data privacy](https://nrecursions.blogspot.com/2018/08/educating-data-privacy-illiterate.html).

# How it works
1. You and your friend decide on a password.  
2. You and your friend open Private Chat on your respective web browsers, start a new chat and enter the password.  
3. You type a message in Private Chat and encrypt it.  
4. Copy the encrypted text from Private Chat and paste it into any other text sharing platform (email/SMS/messaging apps) which you use to chat with your friend.  
5. Your friend receives the encrypted text, copies it, pastes it into their Private Chat and decrypts the text to read it.  
6. Your friend types a reply in Private Chat, encrypts it, copies the encrypted text and pastes it into the text sharing platform.  
7. You receive the message, copy the encrypted text, paste it into Private Chat and decrypt it to read it.
